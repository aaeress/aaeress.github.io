The descriptions of each code file

help.ipynb: This file is written from starter code, and the purpose of this file is to test on each picture individually. All the functions I called in the main.ipynb are from this file.

help.py: This file was converted from the help.ipynb file in order to later import help.ipynb in main.ipynb and use the functions within it.

main.ipynb: This file is responsible for handling some automated processes, such as fetching each image, aligning them, and organizing them into a folder.
