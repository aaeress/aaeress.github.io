    <h1>CS180: Project 1</h1>
    <h2>Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Programming Project</strong><br>
        <strong>Due Date:</strong> September 9th, 2024 at 11:59PM
    </p>
    <p>
        In this project, we utilize image processing techniques to restore and colorize the digitized 
        photos taken by Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863-1944), a pioneering photographer 
        in early color photography. The goal is to align the three color channels (Red, Green, and Blue) 
        from his glass plate negatives to produce a cohesive and visually accurate color image.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Image Alignment</h3>
    <p>
        Initially, I used Euclidean Distance as described in the project documentation to align the three 
        color channels. However, this method did not yield satisfactory results. After experimenting with 
        different approaches, I replaced the Euclidean Distance with the <strong>Structural Similarity (SSIM) Index</strong>, 
        which compares the structural information of two images rather than just pixel-wise differences. 
        This resulted in much more accurate alignment, significantly improving the final image quality.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Image Pyramid and Recursive Alignment</h3>
    <p>
        For handling larger images more efficiently, I implemented a recursive function to construct an 
        <strong>image pyramid</strong>. By scaling down the image and aligning the smaller version first, the algorithm 
        was able to refine the alignment as the image size increased. This hierarchical approach allowed 
        the program to align large images much faster compared to exhaustive search across the original 
        resolution.<br>
        <br>
        For example, when aligning the largest image, <em>self_portrait.tif</em>, without using the image pyramid, 
        the runtime exceeded 20 minutes and the alignment was incomplete. However, with the image pyramid, the alignment 
        was completed in just over two minutes, and the result was much more accurate.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Edge Cropping</h3>
    <p>
        One common issue with colorized images is misalignment at the borders, which often results in unwanted 
        artifacts. To address this, I wrote a function that detects rows and columns where most pixels are 
        either very close to 1 (white) or 0 (black). This function automatically crops the edges that consist 
        mostly of black or white pixels. While this method works reasonably well, I believe a more efficient 
        approach might involve cropping the image based on the calculated displacement vectors, rather than 
        relying solely on pixel intensity.<br>
        <br>
        However, a better approach might be to calculate the average pixel value for each row and column. 
        If every pixel in a row or column is close to the average value, we could crop that row or column, 
        as this would indicate that the row/column shares the same color.
